<h2 id="situation">Situation</h2>
<h3 id="microsoft-has-released-a-major-update-to-edge-on-windows-10-and-made-edge-available-to-windows-7">Microsoft has released a major update to Edge on Windows 10 and made Edge available to Windows 7</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.file-extensions.org/imgs/app-icon/128/11586/microsoft-edge.png" alt="Legacy Edge Icon"><br>
Microsoft Edge, which was introduced with Windows 8 and continued into Windows 10 up to version 45, will be referred to as <em>Legacy Edge</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://udger.com/pub/img/ua/Microsoft_Edge_big.png" alt="New Edge Icon January 2020"><br>
The new version of Microsoft Edge, released on January 15, 2020 beginning with version 79, will be referred to as <em>Edge</em> or <em>Microsoft Edge</em>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h3 id="microsoft-edge-is-not-being-deployed-to-windows-7-and-legacy-edge-is-not-being-updated-on-windows-10-at-this-time.">Microsoft Edge is <strong>not</strong> being deployed to Windows 7 and <em>Legacy Edge</em> is <strong>not</strong> being updated on Windows 10 at this time.</h3>
<p>SA-EDS is <strong>testing</strong> Edge in a controlled environment in order to develop understanding, documentation, and configurations which will be needed for when a decision is made to deploy/update. Windows 10 version 2004 (20H1) will ship with Edge thus replacing <em>Legacy Edge</em></p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<h3 id="internet-explorer-ie-is-not-replaced.">Internet Explorer (IE) is not replaced.</h3>

<ul>
<li>The new Microsoft Edge replaces <em>Legacy Edge</em> on Windows 10.</li>
<li>On Windows 7 there was no previous version of Edge so Edge is installed alongside IE.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="legacy-websites-flash-java--silverlight-are-handled-by-ie">Legacy websites, Flash, Java, &amp; Silverlight are handled by IE</h3>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XczwsnYzin1s6DouuohGP6HCJ62TwFCwwLjpZJJZUZpoR6WKRO8_ii2jQiaZRG_rwKBR4iJ8OBw=s1024" alt="" title="IE Tab in Edge"></p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows 10 the same technology which has redirected legacy websites to IE continues to function as before with the added benefit of displaying pages in a tab and thus not requiring a new window.</li>
<li>On Windows 7 Microsoft Edge will function the same as on Windows 10.</li>
</ul>
<p>NB: <strong><em>Adobe Flash EoL is Dec 2020.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h2>
<ul>
<li>SA-EDS will, along with consultation from relevant stake-holders, determine when and if Edge would be deployed to Windows 7.</li>
<li>SA-EDS will consult on Edge upgrades for Windows 10 to determine when and if the upgrade should be approved for versions of Windows 10 prior to 2004 releasing in 20H1.</li>
<li>Starting with Windows 10 version 2004 (20H1) <em>Legacy Edge</em> will no longer be included in the OS as published by Microsoft; SA-EDS is already working on group policy, Enterprise Mode IE site list, and other configurations to have in place to assure a smooth transition.</li>
</ul>
